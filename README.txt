This is the sourcecode for an open soure texteditor created to fulfill the requirements for Notre Dame's Fundamentals of Computing II course. It is written in C++ and Qt. File written by the group include the codeeditor class, the highlighter class, the linenumberarea class, the mainwindow class, and main.cpp.  All others were taken form the open source spell checking project Hunspell. In order to run the program, you must download the Qt 4.0 or later SDK and then specify the location of these files in your path. Once that is done, you need to make the program.  This can be doen with the included Makefile in the standard way.
